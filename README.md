      Ahoy = Puma + NGINX + Mina + Vagrant + Ansible
```

---

#### Ahoy will generate everything you need to deploy your Rails application

* Ansible scripts to provision your server with Nginx, Ruby, PostgreSQL, and recommended security settings (ssh hardening, firewall, fail2ban, etc.)
* Mina scripts to deploy your Rails application
* Puma application server configuration files
* An optional Vagrantfile with settings
* An *.env* directory that will use YAML to store your environment variables securely


**IMPORTANT:** Ahoy currently expects that your Rails application is using PostgreSQL. Depending on demand, there may be future support for MySQL.

## Installation and usage

**RECOMMENDATION:** You might want to first try this using a fresh Rails application so you can see how it effects your files before running this in your existing code base.

### Step 1

Add the gem to your Gemfile and bundle

```ruby
gem 'rails-ahoy'
```

    $ bundle install

### Step 2

Execute the following terminal command to launch Ahoy's interactive guide

    $ rails generate ahoy:init

Continue to next step AFTER you complete the interactive guide

### Step 3

If you don't have a production *secret_key_base*, generate one using:

    $ rake secret

This will produce something that looks like:

    $ f67395912d0ddd0de80a734822e73b327d007809123...

Now just copy and paste it into the following file:

    $ <YOUR RAILS APP>/.env/production_env.yml

**IMPORTANT:** At this point make sure to commit your changes and push them up to your repo!

### Step 4

**IMPORTANT:** For this step, you will need a freshly installed Ubuntu box with root ssh privileges. If you're not sure how to do this, contact your web hosting administrator.

From within your Rails app...

    $ cd config/ansible
    $ ./production.sh

Executing `production.sh` will launch the provisioning process and setup your box so it can run Rails using Nginx as the web server, Puma as your application server, and PostgreSQL as your database.

**NOTE:** This process may take a while (15 mins or so), so sit back and relax.

### Step 5

**ASSUMPTION:** This step assumes that your code is hosted in a Github repo.

Once the provisioning process is complete, log into your box with the server user (ex: deployer)

    $ ssh deployer@<YOUR SERVER IP>

Once in, get your server user's public key

    $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

This will print out something like this:

	sh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDOv2hw90hySH+41A6NVjp6GXhBS/PUVmTot...

Copy the public key and paste it into your Rails application Github repo settings to allow SSH access.

### Step 6

Go back to the root of your Rails application and execute the following command:

    $ mina production setup

Then...

    $ mina production deploy

### Congratulations!

If everything worked as it should have, your Rails application should be up and running on the Web. Enjoy!
